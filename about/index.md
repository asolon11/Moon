Hi there! I'm Alyssa. I recently graduated from California State University, Los Angeles with a Bachelor's Degree in Computer Science and am currently seeking a job or internship related to Web Development.

Languages that I have worked with are Java, JavaScript, SQL, HTML, CSS, and a little bit of C++.

If you would like to see my résumé, please email me and I shall send it as soon as possible.
