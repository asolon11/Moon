The Post Office Website project was developed by a group of six people. It is a website that reenacts the functionality of an actual Post Office Website. It also has a specific page that only the administrator can access in which she or he may be able to view, edit, or delete the customer, employee, and order/package information.

Customer functions:
* Create an account and login
* View their orders/package information

Languages used to create this project are:
* PHP
* MySQL
* HTML
* CSS
