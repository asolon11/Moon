The Service Hours Log is an application for volunteer groups to use for keeping records of their volunteers and the service hours they have completed. This is a personal project that I am currently working on whenever I get the chance. I am creating the project based on the perspective of an administrator. The administrator will have the ability to add, edit, and delete particular fields that the volunteer will not be able to access. The volunteer will only be able to input the hours they have done and the associated activity. This is to ensure that the volunteer doesn't take advantage and input false information.

Admin Functions (Anticipated):
* Add, Edit, and Delete a volunteer and their contributed hours
* Add, Edit, and Delete the events that the volunteer was involved in

Volunteer Functions (Anticipated):
* Input the number of services hours they have done and the event they were a part of.

Languages used in this project are:
* SQL
* PHP
* HTML
* CSS

Database:
* MySQL
