The Layer Analyzation project is an analytical tool that is used to analyze single or multiple layers available on JPL's [Moontrek](https://moontrek.jpl.nasa.gov) Application. The possible calculations available for the analysis upon the selection of a single layer are minimum, maximum, average, median, standard deviation, variance, and histogram. If multiple layers are selected, the calculations that are available are correlation, covariance, and clustering. Various graphs are also presented to the user depending on what is selected.

This project was developed by a group of six people. I was the Documentation Lead and assisted with creating python scripts to display correlations between multiple layers. We collaborated with JPL in hopes to further enhance the knowledge of the users of Moontrek about the different layers of elements on the Moon.

Language used:
* Python
